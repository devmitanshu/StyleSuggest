This application is used to detect the kind of garment,such as ladies tops, etc., and make correct suggestions for related items. We have used open-source computer vision libraries, such as TensorFlow and OpenCV, to make development and integration with the dataset given to us.

The image dataset given to us consist of ladies clothing. Therefore uploading ladies garments will work for this model. The same model can be used for a huge dataset of garments for any gender.
